## Overview
This Java project implements a route planning algorithm, designed to efficiently calculate the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. The algorithm avoids the use of complex data structures like queues, focusing instead on fields, variables, and arrays for simplicity and ease of understanding. We used a database we created to compare flight times and distances to provide the user with the fastest and quickest flight route options.

## Features
- **Shortest Path Calculation:** Computes the shortest route between two nodes in a graph.
- **No Complex Data Structures:** Implements the algorithm using only basic Java constructs such as fields, variables, and arrays.
- **Modular Code:** Easy to integrate with other projects or extend with additional functionality.
